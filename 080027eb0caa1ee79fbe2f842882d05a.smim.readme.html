<h1>SAP on Linux</h1>
  <h2>SAP NetWeaver 7.5 SPS2 - <b>TestDrive</b></h2>
  <p>This download provides the software required to install and run SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP 7.5 SPS2
    (NW7.5) You can explore SAP's current generation ABAP Application server; learn how to develop web applications; and get an overview of
    SAP's client/server technology. </p>
  <p> Please bear in mind that a productive SAP System is designed and optimized for mission-critical applications in a business environment with thousands of parallel
    users. </p>
  <p>Consult the provided SAP DEVELOPER CENTER MASTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPER LICENSE AGREEMENT for 
  SAP-granted usage rights on the included components as listed below.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SAP NetWeaver 7.5 SPS2</li>
    <li>SAP GUI for the Java Environment 7.40 and SAP GUI for Windows 7.40 in recent versions</li>
    <li>SAP Sybase ASE 16.0.1</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>You need to read and accept the Software End User License Agreement</p>
  <p>The 7.5 TestDrive has been successfully tested with recent versions of the following distributions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SUSE SLES</li>
    <li>Open SUSE</li>
    <li>Fedora</li>
    <li>RHEL</li>
    <li>Ubuntu and Debian: You need to install csh before you start the installation!</li>
    <li>Other distributions may require manual setup.</li>    
  </ul>
     <br>It is mandatory that you use a 64-Bit OS version.</br>
  <p>Hardware requirements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>x86_64 Processor based hardware</li>
    <li>At least 4 GB RAM plus about 8 GB swap space</li>
    <li>About 80 GB free disk space for server installation </li>
    <li>About 2 GB free disk space for client installation </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Installation Instructions and First Steps</h2>
  <h3>Step 1: Prerequisites</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Network configuration of the SAP host operating system: The officially supported setup requires a static IP address for the hostname used for the SAP installation. Using DHCP is possible for this Testdrive version, but be aware of potential consequences. 
	If our installation cannot ping the hostname specified when installing, installation and startup of the SAP system will fail. 
	Make sure that the hostname specified during installation fulfills SAP requirements, 
	most importantly it cannot exceed 13 characters length and also needs to survive subsequent reboots. 
	We strongly recommend that you stick to <b>vhcalnplci</b> as hostname used by the SAP system and make sure 
	that this hostname remains pingable after subsequent restarts of the server. 
	</li>
	<li>The firewall should be deactivated.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Step 2: Server Installation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Login with your preferred user. You need to have the password of the root user at hand, since the installation needs root privileges.</li>
    <li>Extract downloaded archive: <code>unzip archive.zip</code>.</li>
    <li>Go into the root directory of the installation, set <code>install.sh</code> to executable and execute: <ol><li><code>chmod +x install.sh</code></li><li><code>sudo ./install.sh</code></li></ol>
		More detailed installation instructions are provided in dedicated SCN blogs so that we can address your incoming suggestions.
		</li>
    <li>Installation will take a while (about 20 minutes - take a coffee).</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Start the SAP system 
      <ol><li>Switch to user npladm with default password Appl1ance in the console : su npladm</li>
      <li>Start the SAP system : startsap ALL</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Log on to the system as user SAP* with default password Appl1ance and use transaction SLICENSE (transaction code slicense) to ascertain your hardware key. Alternatively, you can get your hardware key by executing <code>/usr/sap/NPL/SYS/exe/run/saplicense
          -get</code>.</li>
      <li>Request the license key for your TestDrive by selecting the value 'NPL - SAP Netweaver 7.x (Sybase ASE)' for System ID and by entering your hardware key in
        the section System Info on <a href="http://www.sap.com/minisap">SAP Sneak Preview License Key Request </a> . You
        should receive an e-mail shortly after sending the data with a license
        file attached.</li>
      <li>In SLICENSE, install the license file.</li>
      <li>IMPORTANT: If you log on with the user DEVELOPER, then the first time you create an object, you will be asked for a user key.
	Enter the following key exactly: 35408798513176413512. <br>Please note that all the above steps must be carried out; otherwise, the above user key will not work.
    </ol>
  </ul>
<h3>Administration of SAP NW ABAP 7.5 TestDrive</h3>
    <h4>Administration of SAP NW ABAP 7.5 using SAP Management Console SAPMC</h4>
	<ul>Assuming that your browser is configured to run Java applets and that the NPL server host (example: <code>vhcalnplci</code>)  
	is reachable from your OS, enter <a href="http://vhcalnplci:50013">http://vhcalnplci:50013</a>. 
	SAPMC allows you to start, stop, and analyse the SAP system and its components with great ease of use, remote and/or local. 
	Alternatively, use the command line sapcontrol commands (not described here) or the deprecated startsap and stopsap commands.
  	</ul>
  </ul>
  <h4>Created directories and a new hostname</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The installed system creates the following directories:</li>
    <table border="0">
        <caption align="bottom" style="italic">
        Table 2: Directories
        </caption>	
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Directory</th>
          <th>Size</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>/sapmnt</td>
          <td align="right">~ 2 GB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>/sybase</td>
          <td align="right">~ 50 GB</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>/usr/sap</td>
          <td align="right">~ 3 GB</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <li>If you prefer to provide dedicated disk space for the directories shown in table 2, do so before you invoke the script.
	Please be aware that the used extraction will overwrite dynamic links, so we suggest to use bind mounts in order to persist SAP paths in your host OS /etc/fstab.
     Assuming that you have made disk space available on directory <code>/sap</code>, <code>/etc/fstab</code> entry 
	 <code>/sap/sybase /sybase none bind 0 0</code> will make the sybase directory (directories must exist!) available at the right location 
	 while occupying disk space on the device you have added for running the TestDrive.	
		</li>
   <li>The installation does not cater for any hostname requirements, 
	so please make sure that you have understood the requirements before you execute the installation script.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Created users</h4>
  <ul>
	  <li>The installed system creates the following OS users; you are prompted for a master password during installation:</li>
    <table border="0">
	        <caption align="bottom">
        Table 3: OS Users
        </caption>
      <thead>

          <th>username</th>
          <th>password</th>
          <th>description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>sapadm</td>
	  <td>&times;</td>
          <td>Created by SAP Hostagent, you can manually assign a  password</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>sybnpl</td>
	  <td>&times;</td>
          <td>SAP Database Administrator</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <li>The installed system the following SAP Users makes the following users available in client 001:</li>
    <table border="0">
	        <caption align="bottom">
        Table 4: SAP Users

          <th>password</th>
          <th>description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>DDIC</td>
          <td>Appl1ance</td>
          <td>Data Dictionary User</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>DEVELOPER</td>
          <td>Appl1ance</td>
          <td>Developer User</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>BWDEVELOPER</td>
          <td>Appl1ance</td>
          <td>Developer User</td>
        <tr>
          <td>SAP*</td>
          <td>Appl1ance</td>
